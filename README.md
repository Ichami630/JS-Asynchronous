# Callbacks
### Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions. They are executed after the completion of a specific task. However, nested callbacks can lead to callback hell, making the code hard to read and maintain.

# Promise
### Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell. They represent a value that might be available now, in the future, or never. Promises have a chainable API for handling success and failure using .then() and .catch().

# Async/Await
### Async functions make asynchronous code look synchronous, making it easier to read and write. Async functions always return a Promise, and within them, you can use the await keyword to pause execution until a Promise is resolved or rejected.
